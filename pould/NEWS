   and the availability of an updated gap package on GitHub.

Changes in version 0.5.0.9000 (2018-05-18)
  o Modified LDWrap() to avoid calling cALD() for locus pairs in which at least
   one locus is monomorphic. In these cases, the *LD_results.csv file identifies
   which loci were monomorphic for that locus pair.
  o Updated documentation to reflect this.

Changes in version 0.4.2.9000 (2018-05-12)
  o Streamlined the integration of cALD() into LDWrap().
  
Changes in version 0.4.1.9000 (2018-05-11)

   spelling errors, and elaborate on documentation for cALD()'s report of the
   number of haplotypes. 

Changes in version 0.4.0.9000 (2018-05-08)
  o Added the number of haplotypes evaluated to the values returned by cALD(),  
   and thereby to the content of the *LD_results.csv file generated by LDWrap().
  o Updated the documentation to reflect this.
  
Changes in version 0.3.0.9000 (2018-05-03)
  o Revised drb1.dqb1.demo so that it represents phased DRB1~DQB1 data pulled 
   directly from hla.hap.demo.
  o Added README.Rmd and README.md files for GitHub.
  o Added NEWS.

  o Changed LDWrap() notification for input data lacking required columns, to 
   reflect the data source as either a data frame or a file. 
  o Removed the passFile parameter from cALD(), and updated documentation.

Changes in version 0.2.1.9000 (2018-04-30)
