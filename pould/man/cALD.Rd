\title{Calculation of the \eqn{D'}, \eqn{Wn}, and conditional Asymmetric LD Measures}
\usage{
cALD(dataSet, inPhase = FALSE, verbose = TRUE, reportVector = FALSE,
  vectorName = "", vectorPrefix = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{dataSet}{A data frame or tab delimited file consisting of four columns of genotype data named, e.g. locus1_1 locus1_2 locus2_1 locus2_2, with 1 row per sample. The columns must be organized in this exact order, but the column names should not have _1 or _2 appended; use the same locus name for each column of a given locus. For phased data, locus1_1 is in phase with locus2_1, and locus1_2 is in phase with locus_2_2. Because this funciton operates on locus pairs, any rows with missing data should be excluded from the input genotype data.}

\item{inPhase}{A boolean identifying the genotyping data as phased or unphased (TRUE = phased; FALSE = unphased); default is unphased.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean identifying if results should be printed to the console (verbose = TRUE), or returned in a vector of (\eqn{D'}, \eqn{Wn}, \eqn{WLocus2/Locus1}, \eqn{WLocus1/Locus2}, number of haplotypes) (verbose = FALSE)}

\item{reportVector}{A boolean identifying if the vector of all haplotypes should be exported as a text file (reportVector = TRUE), or not (reportVector = FALSE).}

\item{vectorName}{A name for the exported haplotype vector file ; this name is not used if reportVector = False. If a name is unspecified, then a filename including the locus-pair and a timestamp is generated.}

\item{vectorPrefix}{An optional prefix for the haplotpe vector to be used if reportVector = TRUE. This prefix will be appended, along with the phase status, before the locus name and timestamp.}
}
\value{
A vector of \eqn{D'}, \eqn{Wn}, \eqn{WLocus2/Locus1}, \eqn{WLocus1/Locus2} values, and the number of haplotypes evaluated
}
\description{
Calculates \eqn{D'}, \eqn{Wn} (Cramer's V) and Thomson and Single's conditional asymmetric LD (\eqn{ALD}) measures for pairs of loci.
}
\details{
LD results can be directed to the console or to a data file or data frame object. This function can generate a haplotype vector file for each locus pair analyzed, and will return the LD results eiher in the console, or as a data frame object.
The implementation of ALD applied here is calculated using individual \eqn{Dij} LD values and allele frequencies.
}
\examples{
# Using the included HLA-DRB1 HLA-DQB1 genotype data to report LD results to the console
cALD(drb1.dqb1.demo)
# Alternatively returning a vector of LD results
LDvec <- cALD(drb1.dqb1.demo,verbose=FALSE)
